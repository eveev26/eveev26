 # 👋 Hello, I'm Ivy

💻 Computer Science Student | 🚀 Aspiring Data Scientist

Welcome to my GitHub profile! Here you'll find some of my projects, contributions, and a glimpse into my coding journey.

## 🛠️ Projects

Here are a few projects I'm proud of:

1. [Library Database](https://github.com/eveev26/Library-Database): Library database that displays all the books available in a custom library. Users can search for a specific book and sort the database based on author or title. Users can also log into their account and borrow a book or they can return it instead. Built with Django, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and PostgreSQL.
2. [SpeechSummarizer](https://github.com/eveev26/SpeechSummarizer): Submitted to Ignition Hacks 2023 and won Best Mobile App. Record your team having a meeting and then upload a video/audio file onto our app. SpeechSummarizer will then convert your meeting audio into condensed and informative meeting minutes. 
3. [Virtual Pet Simulator](https://github.com/eveev26/Virtual-Pet-Simulator): A Greenfoot project that lets players take care of a virtual pet bunny. Players can feed and play with Bunny by dragging items to him. 

You can explore more of my projects on my [GitHub Repositories](https://github.com/eveev26?tab=repositories).
